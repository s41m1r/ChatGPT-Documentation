## Overview

The Facebook Graph API serves as the primary gateway for interacting programmatically with the Facebook platform. It is an HTTP/1.1 compliant API. In this guide, we'll dive into its technical specifics, including endpoint structures, request parameters, and more.

### Technical Specifics
- **Protocol**: HTTP/1.1 over HTTPS
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens
- **Client Libraries**: Any language with an HTTP library, such as cURL, urllib, etc.

---

## HTTP Specifications

Ensure your requests conform to HTTP/1.1 and are made over HTTPS. The Graph API works seamlessly with any programming language with HTTP library support. The HSTS directive `includeSubdomains` is enabled on facebook.com but shouldn't interfere with API calls.

---

## Endpoint URL Structure

The Graph API predominantly uses `graph.facebook.com` for its endpoints. However, video uploads use `graph-video.facebook.com`.

---

## Access Tokens

Access tokens are critical for authentication and authorization. You'll mostly use OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens. Tokens perform dual roles:

1. **User Data Access**: Enables secure retrieval of user information without requiring the user's password.
2. **App Identification**: Provides a mechanism for identifying your application and the scope of data it can access.

> **Note**: Always include the `access_token` query parameter in your API calls unless specified otherwise.

---

## Nodes

Nodes represent individual entities in Facebook's social graph, like Users, Pages, Groups, etc. To query a user's basic information:

```bash
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/USER-ID?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"
```

### Metadata

To list all available fields of a node, add the `metadata=1` parameter.

```bash
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/USER-ID?metadata=1&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"
```

---

## Edges

Edges are relationships between nodes. For example, to get photos connected to a User node:

```bash
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/USER-ID/photos?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"
```

---

## Fields

You can specify which fields you want in the returned data using the `fields` parameter:

```bash
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/USER-ID?fields=id,name,email,picture&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"
```

---

## Request Parameters

The API supports complex types such as lists and objects in JSON format. For example:

- **List**: `["firstitem", "seconditem", "thirditem"]`
- **Object**: `{"firstkey": "firstvalue", "secondKey": 123}`

---

## CRUD Operations

- **Create**: POST
- **Read**: GET
- **Update**: POST with updated fields
- **Delete**: DELETE

### Read-After-Write

You can immediately read the fields of an object after a POST operation by including the `fields` parameter.

---

## Error Handling

Standard error responses are returned in JSON. Check the official 'Handling Errors' guide for comprehensive error codes and possible resolutions.

---

## Webhooks

Subscribe to node changes using webhooks. This allows real-time updates from the Graph API to your application.

---

## Versioning

Specify API version by appending `v` followed by the version number in the URL. For example, for version 4.0:

```bash
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v4.0/USER-ID/photos?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN"
```
